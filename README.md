# Generation Scotland MDD GWAS removing overlap with UK Biobank

Overlap between Generation Scotland and  UK Biobank was assessed in [Howard et al 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03819-3) and [Howard et al 2019]( https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-018-0326-7). In those analyses, overlap was handled by removing participants from the UKB data sets. Here, we remove them from the GenScot datasets.
